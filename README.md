## Design specification
This section shows the design decisions I made for the UI and branding of the website.
### Logo

I designed the logo using Figma.

I decided to use [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) from Google fonts because I think it has a playful, friendly, and rounded style, which matches the branding I want.

I wanted to incorporate an environmental/eco-friendly symbol into the logo, so I found an
[Eco](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:eco:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.query=eco&icon.size=24&icon.color=%23e3e3e3)
symbol from Google material symbols. I added it to the font by converting the font to a path in figma, shortening the "I" and putting the eco symbol on top so it resembles a lowercase "i".
